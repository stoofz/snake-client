# Snake Client Project

Snake is a classic video game, easy to play and highly addictive. The player maneuvers the snake around the screen to eat pieces of food. The more it eats, the more it grows. Get as long as possible without bumping into walls, yourself, or other players!

This is a multiplayer client for Snek, a take on Snake.

Before you can run this client, you will need to run the Snek server which you can download and install from [here](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/snek-multiplayer).
